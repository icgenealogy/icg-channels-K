TITLE potassium Kv3.1 membrane channel for STh

COMMENT
 Potassium Kv3.1 membrane channel for STh.  Based on derived kinetics
 from Wigmore & Lacey 2000.  Their primary experiments were performed
 at 32degC

 How the q10 works: There is a q10 for the rates (alpha and beta's)
 called Q10 and a Q10 for the maximum conductance called gmaxQ10.  The
 q10s should have been measured at specific temperatures temp1 and
 temp2 (that are 10degC apart). Ideally, as Q10 is temperature
 dependant, we should know these two temperatures.  We are going to
 follow the more formal Arrhenius derived Q10 approach.  The
 temperature at which this channel's kinetics were recorded is tempb
 (base temperature).  What we then need to calculate is the desired
 rate scale for now working at temperature celsius (rate_k).  This is
 given by the empirical Arrhenius equation, using the Q10.
